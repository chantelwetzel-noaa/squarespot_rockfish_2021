This assessment reports the status of squarespot rockfish (\emph{Sebastes hopkinsi}) off the U.S. West Coast using data through 2020. Squarespot rockfish is a small bodied rockfish found from Mexico to southern Oregon, with a core distribution in southern California. This species is treated as one stock, as there is no evidence of population structure.

Squarespot rockfish are commonly found in depths between 60 - 119 meters, hovering over or sheltering in rocky reef habitat and aggregating with other smaller rockfishes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. and Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Squarespot rockfish are yellow-brown, brown, or tan on the back and sides with lighter colored bellies. Squarespot rockfish is a dwarf species of rockfish with dimorphic growth between the sexes. Female squarespot rockfish reach larger sizes compared to males, with females reaching maximum sizes around 29 cm.

Squarespot rockfish are generally undesirable in the recreational and commercial fishery due to their small size (maximum length of 29 cm; {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love Milton, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), though they sometimes contribute to the composition of recreational bag limits. Females grow larger than males, and only nearing their maximum length do they reach a size that is marginally acceptable to anglers, thus the landings are primarily composed of older females. While there is some anecdotal evidence of directed commercial fishing using small hooks, they are often discarded as bycatch and commercial catch is relatively low over the entire catch history. The stock has been managed as part of the Minor Shelf Rockfish South Complex since 2000, for which access for both the commercial and recreational fisheries have been restricted with rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) to rebuild overfished stocks (Appendix A).

The California recreational fishery in the early part of the 20th century was focused on nearshore waters near ports, but expanded further from port and into deeper depths over time {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Prior to the rebuilding period for overfished species after the groundfish fishery disaster was declared in 2000, there was access to all depths and year-round seasons for groundfishes (Appendix A). Most of the catch of squarespot rockfish in the recreational fishery comes from south of Point Conception. North of Point Conception to Pigeon Point near Santa Cruz at the northern extent of their common range, the depth restrictions have been 40 fm or less until it was increased to 50 fm in 2017, which still provides some protection for the stock. South of Point Conception the depth restrictions have been 20 to 60 fm since 2000 providing more access than to the north, until 2019 when depth restrictions increased to 75 fm, then to 100 fm 2021. This depth restriction change was due to the rebuilding of cowcod allowing liberalization of the RCA, providing access to the majority of the stock as they are found as deep as 123 fm, but are common to 83 fm {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love Milton, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Squarespot rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Shelf Rockfish South and North complexes. The North and South areas are split at N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. While squarespot rockfish is included in the Shelf Rockfish North complex, the contribution from squarespot rockfish is extremely low (\textless{} 0.5 mt) because the vast majority of the distribution of the stock is in the southern region of California. The Shelf Rockfish complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The complex OFLs and ACLs are determined by summing the species specific OFLs and ACLs managed within the complex. Removals for species within the Shelf Rockfish complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

The recreational removals prior to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Recreational removals from 1980 - 2003 were obtained from MRFSS and provide total mortality (observed landings plus dead discarded fish). The missing years, 1990-1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1992 values. Removals years 2004 - 2020 were sampled by the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) and combine estimates of retained, dead discarded, and unreported landings. Both the MRFSS and CRFS reported removals were downloaded from RecFIN.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Estimates of recreational discard mortality for the period 1980 - 2020 are based on angler reported discards that can underestimate removals of less desirable species. Underestimation may occur because recall of encounters with undesirable species can be low, as well as indentification issues among anglers given the diversity of Sebastes found in California, with at least 36 species regularly encountered in the recreational fishery. Since 2006, efforts have been made to improve angler identification skills by providing laminated groundfish identification guides and posters to CPFVs to improve compliance with species specific regulations. Comparisons of the discard rates from retained and discarded catch estimates compared to discard rates from onboard sampling observations of the composition of retained and discarded fish tallied by the observer along each drift for a limited number of anglers indicated underestimates of up roughly 3 times that reported (Table ). A sensitivity was performed to increasing the discard by 3 times as much in the

Length data (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}) for retained recreational catches sourced by MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2020) were downloaded from the RecFIN website. The lengths of discarded fish measured by samplers onboard CPFVs prior to being released (Type 3d data) from 2003 to 2020 were also downloaded from the RecFIN website. The number of length observation by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:rec-len}. The highest samples by year occurred within the last 16 years of the modeled period. The recreational lengths reflect limited signalling of recruitment strength in the length data as only the largest individuals are taken (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). The mean size observed ranged between 20 to approximately 25 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-data}).The small size of squarespot rockfish and hook size likely limits the ability of hook and line gear to observe smaller fish.

The commercial removals for squarespot rockfish are extremely sparse throughout the time series. The small size and affinity for rocky reefs makes this both an undesirable fish to market, and one difficult to reach with trawl gear. were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl,' and `unknown' gear categories. Commercial landing between 1969 - 1980 were queried from the CALCOM database. Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database, extracted 22 February, 2021.

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data between 1916 to 2001 to account for total removals was calculated based on the average discard rates from WCGOP of 28 percent.

The annual length samples from the commercial fishery was limited (Table \ref{tab:com-len}). The sizes observed were generally between 20 - 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:bubble-comm-len-data} and Figure \ref{fig:comm-mean-len-data}). Given the limited number of samples by year and the lack of commercial catches in the removal time series, the commerical removals were added to the recretaional samples and the commercial lengths were excluded. A sensitivity to assuming 1 (recreational only) or 2 (commerical and recreational) fleets were explored.

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus \emph{Sebastes} at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure \ref{fig:hkl-sites}) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the \gls{s-hkl} are bocaccio (\emph{S. paucispinis}), cowcod (\emph{S. levis}), greenspotted (\emph{S. chlorostictus}), and vermilion (\emph{S. miniatus} and \emph{S. crocotulus}) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(J. Harms, Benante, and Barnhart 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Squarespot rockfish have been observed at multiple sampling site by the \Gls{s-hkl} survey each year between 2004 - 2019 (Table \ref{tab:hkl-len}). The number of positive observations has increased sharply starting in 2014 which coincided with the \gls{s-hkl} began sampling sites located within the cowcod conservation area (CCA, Figure \ref{fig:hkl-cca}). Squarespot rockfish have been observed both outside and inside the CCA and the increased observation rate starting in 2014 appeared to occur both outside and inside the CCA. The increased observations of squarespot rockfish both inside and outside the CCA indicates that this change may be driven by recent strong year classes rather than a change in sampling location (John Harms, NOAA NWFSC, pers. comm.).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The squarespot rockfish observed by the \Gls{s-hkl} are primarily mature females which is likely due to the small size of male squarespot rockfish, competition among other rockfishes, and hook size (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-data}). The mean size of fish observed by the \Gls{s-hkl} has been relatively stable (Figure \ref{fig:mean-hkl-len-data}).

An annual index of abundance was calculated from the \Gls{s-hkl} data following the methods put forth in Harms et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} based on the AIC criterion. The index of abundance was calculated using a binomial generalized-linear model. The final index includes year, site, number of hooks, fisher, drop number, and moon fullness (as a polynomial) as covariates. The single index of abundance was calculated using both observation outside and within the CCA (Table \ref{tab:hkl-index-vals} and Figure \ref{fig:hkl-index}). The index of abundances was low and relatively flat until 2014 when the index sharply increases, hitting a high in 2018.

The \gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Bradburn, Keller, and Horness 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The \gls{s-wcgbt} has observed squarespot rockfish each year of the survey, however, the number of positive tows are limited (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts-len}). Sine the \Gls{s-wcgbt} uses trawl gear to sample sandy bottom areas off the West Coast, \emph{apriori} it would not be expected to be an informative data source for squarespot rockfish which are closely associated with rock substrate. The limited tows by year where squarespot rockfish were observed within this area, preventing the calculation of an index of abundance using spatial temporal methods (e.g., VAST) for squarespot rockfish. A design-based index calculated resulted in high variability and uncertainty by year (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbts-dbindex}). With limited length observations and in the absence of a VAST index of abundance to link these data to, this data set was not used in the base model.

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female squarespot rockfish using data collected from fishery-independent data sources off the coast of California that were collected from 2004-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps} and Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). Males are smaller than females, but much less susceptible to capture by hook and line, so the trawl fishery provided an important source of small individuals. Figure \ref{fig:len-age} shows the lengths and ages for all years by data source as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

Initial exploration used the longevity estimate of 45 years based on 90\% of the age of the oldest sampled individual (a 50 year old female; oldest male was 49). We therefore assumed the age of 45 years to represent the practical longevity for both females and males. Methods using the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were also considered (Figure \ref{fig:M_female}), but they produced unreasonably high estimates (2-3 times higher than the longevity estimates). This is likely explained by the fact that while squarespot rockfish are a smaller rockfish species, they still have protracted longevity comparable to stocks that are twice their maximum size. Additionally, the FishLife tool {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson, Munch, et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimate was included, though, given the source of FishLife data is FishBase, there is a good chance the estimates of M are also from longevity estimates, but from an unknown longevity estimate. The final composite distributionn (Figure \ref{fig:M_composite_dists}) are based on 4 empirical estimators, and result in a median value of 0.133 (mean of 0.136), with a CV of 0.22, demonstrating high coherence among the four estimators. We explore sensitivity to these assumptions of natural mortality.

The model assumes a ``data-moderate'' category 2 approach, meaning removal histories, length compositions and fishery-independent abundancies are the approved data inputs. All other data types (e.g., ages) can be use external to the model to inform parameters inputs. The squarespot rockfish model assumes a recreational fleet (that includes the very small commercial catches) with removals beginning in 1916. The NWFSC Hook and Line survey represented the one fishery-independant data source used. Selectivities for all fleets were specified using the double normal parameterization within SS where selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic with the ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters estimated. Life history parameters are sex-specific, with one growth type, and assumed stationary. Recruitment assumes a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship and are deterministic.

Sensitivity scenarios and likelihood profiles were used to explore uncertainty in the values of the natural mortality and growth parameters. When estimating parameters, the prior for natural mortality was assumed lognormal with a standard deviation of 0.22 (based on the prior developed using the Natural Mortality Tool (see Biology section for more details)), and the prior for the growth parameters ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(t_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was assumed normal with the mean equal to the fixed value with a CV of 10\% (this is equal to the CV at length in the model, and maintains the ratio of variance between {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}).

The reference model estimates additional variance on the NWFSC Hook and Line survey data to allow the model to balance model fit to that data while acknowledging that variances may be underestimated in the index.

Initial sample sizes for the recreational length compositions and NWFSC Hook and Line survey were based on the number of fish sampled. The method of Francis ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, equation TA1.8) was then used to balance the length composition data among other data inputs and likelihood components. The Francis method treats mean length as an index, with effective sample size defining the variance around the mean. If the variability around the mean does not encompass model predictions, the length data should be down-weighted until predictions fit within the intervals. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution), but can be sensitive to years that are outliers, as the amount of down-weighting is applied to all years within a data source, and are not year-specific. Sensitivities were performed examining different data-weighting treatments: no data-weighting of lengths, using the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean approach {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(McAllister and Ianelli 1997)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, or the Dirichlet-Multinomial approach {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson, Johnson, et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

The base assessment model for squarespot rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory and realtive stock status for the population of squarespot rockfish for federal waters off California. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model. These include considerations of model structure, data and parameter treatment, estimation phasing, and jittered starting values to achieve a converged and balanced model that provides sensible parameter estimates and derived quantities.

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not relect a local likelihood minimu. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 0.1\%. This was repeated 100 times with 92 out of 100 runs returned to the reference model likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:jitter_01}). A better fit, lower negative log-likelihood, model was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, the reference model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Annual length composition fits are shown in {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Lengths are generally better sample post 2004 in the CRFS sampling period, though the MRFSS period contains several years of decent sampled sizes.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The model fits well the aggregate lengths for the unsexed fishery fleet and survey female length data, with an acceptable, but noticeabley poorer fit to the male survey lengths. The biologically smaller males are encountered with much less frequency given the selectivity of the hook and line gera, and thus males samples sizes are much smaller and sporadic over time compared to the other data sources. This leads to spiky and less resolved length compositions, though the overall fit is reasonable. The mode of the aggregate female lengths is larger than the fishery data, though given the lack of sex-specific fishery lengths and prominent sex-specific growth, it is not apparent whether the Hook-and-Line survey acutally catches bigger fish than the recreational fishery.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Pearson residuals of the fishery length data are generally low with no distinct pattern of misfitting (Figure \ref{fig:rec-com-pearson}). Despite the lack of recruitment estimation, there are no obvious patterns of missed recruitment. The fishery mean lengths fits, assuming Francis data-weighting, show a relatively stable mean length index, with a drop in size in the most recent years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-com-mean-len-fit}). This observed decline in mean lengths was well fit despite the rigid nature (e.g., few estimated parameters and deterministic recruitment) of the model.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Pearson residuals for the survey data are larger than the better sampled fishery data, but in general also do not present any distinct residual pattern (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-pearson}). Largest residuals were with male samples at bigger sizes, where the model assumed less males were exected than observed. This discrepancy, outside the issue with Pearson residuals being sensitive to small samples, could also be due to either sex-misidentification or the need for a higher CV at length for males, though not a major source of uncertainty in the squarespot rockfish assessment. Fits to the mean lengths (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-mean-len-fit}) again support relatively stable mean lengths with littel contrast. The male lengths provide little information on stock status, as only the largest males near {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} are taken. The female data, from which the spawning stock status is measured, provides more information as mean length is below, but includes in uncertainty, the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} value.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The fit to the Hook and Line survey index is generally poor, as the index is much more dynamic and indicative of a general increase in the most recent few years (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-index-fit}). This opposes the trend in the fishery and survey lengths mostly showing a small decrease in the most recent years. The survey values are very low and the CVs are intially large (\textasciitilde40\% CV), but the model adds twice as much variance (0.85), limiting the influence of the survey in the model.

Estimated spawning output shows a large decline starting in the 1970s, with a continued decline into the 1980s. This tracks the large removals during this time period. A large decline in removals starting in the mid-1980s and into the 1990s is reflected in apopulation that begins a steady increase into the early 2010s. Recent high removals (the biggest in the recorded removal history) have again caused a stark population decline.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The 2021 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the rockfish relative biomass target of 40 percent but greater that the management limit of 25 percent (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(1-SPR\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, was above the harvest rate limit ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) between the 1970s and early 1980s, below the target for much of the time from the mid-1980s to early 2010s, but the most recent several years have exceeded the target (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.72.

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by XX\%. This was repeated 100 times with XX out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. We are very grateful to all the agers at WDFW, ODFW, and the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Jason Jannot and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. Peter Frey and John Harms were incredibly helpful in facilitating the understanding of the STAT team as to why and when each of our assessments either encounter or do not squarespot rockfish along the coast.

All of the data moderate assessment assessments this year were greatly benefited by the numerous individuals who took the time to participate in the pre-assessment data webinar. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, and Daniel Platt were provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the West Coast of the U.S. which were essential in the production of all of the squarespot rockfish assessments conducted this year.
