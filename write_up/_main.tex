This assessment reports the status of squarespot rockfish (\emph{Sebastes hopkinsi}) off the U.S. West Coast using data through 2020. Squarespot rockfish is a relatively small rockfish found from Mexico to southern Oregon, with a core distribution in southern California. This species is treated as one stock, as there is no evidence of population structure.

Squarespot rockfish is a dwarf species of rockfish commonly found in depths between 60 - 123 m (33-68 fm), hovering over or sheltering in rocky reef habitat and aggregating with other smaller rockfishes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Squarespot rockfish are yellow-brown, brown, or tan on the back and sides with lighter colored bellies. Squarespot rockfish has sex-specific growth with females reaching larger sizes (29 cm) than males (23 cm). They are mainly plantivores, eating crustaceans such as cyrinid larvae.

Squarespot rockfish are generally undesirable in the recreational and commercial fishery due to their small size ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson (2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). Females grow larger than males, and only nearing their maximum length do they reach a size that is marginally acceptable to anglers, thus the landings are primarily composed of older females. While there is some anecdotal evidence of directed commercial fishing using small hooks, they are often discarded as bycatch and commercial catch is relatively low over the entire catch history. The stock has been managed as part of the Minor Shelf Rockfish South Complex since 2000, for which access for both the commercial and recreational fisheries have been restricted with rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) to rebuild overfished stocks (Appendix A).

In the early part of the 20th century the California recreational fishery was focused on nearshore waters near ports, but expanded further from port and into deeper depths over time {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Prior to the rebuilding period for overfished species after the groundfish fishery disaster was declared in 2000, there was access to all depths and seasons for groundfishes (Appendix A). Most of the catch of squarespot rockfish in the recreational fishery comes from south of Point Conception, consistent with the species range. For areas north of Point Conception to Pigeon Point near Santa Cruz (the northern extent of squarespot rockfish range), the shallow depth limit of the Rockfish Conservation Area was 40 fm (73 m) and was increased to 50 fm (91 m) in 2017, both provides some protection for squarespot rockfish. South of Point Conception the depth restrictions were 20 to 60 fm (36-110 m) after 2000, providing more access compare to the north, until 2019 when depth restrictions started at 75 fm (137 m), then to 100 fm (183 m) in 2021. This depth restriction change was due to the rebuilding of cowcod, providing access to the majority of the squarespot rockfish depth range as they are found as deep as 123 fm, but are common to 83 fm {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M.

Squarespot rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Minor Shelf Rockfish North and South complexes. The North and South areas are split at N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. While squarespot rockfish is included in the Shelf Rockfish North complex, the OFL contribution from squarespot rockfish is extremely low (\textless{} 0.5 mt) because the vast majority of the distribution of the stock is in the southern region of California. The Shelf Rockfish complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The complex OFLs and ACLs are determined by summing the species specific OFLs and ACLs managed within the complex. Removals for species within the Minor Shelf Rockfish complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

The recreational removals prior to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Recreational removals from 1980 - 2003 were obtained from MRFSS and provide total mortality (observed landings plus dead discarded and unavailable fish). Missing years of removals (1990-1992) were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1993 removals. Removals in years 2004 - 2020 were derived from samples taken by the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS). CRFS reported removals combine estimates of retained, dead discarded, and unreported landings. Both the MRFSS and CRFS reported removals were downloaded from RecFIN.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Estimates of recreational discard mortality for the period 1980 - 2020 are based on angler reported discards that can underestimate removals of less desirable species. Underestimation may occur because recall of encounters with undesirable species can be low, as well as {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(Sebastes\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} indentification issues among anglers (at least 36 rockfishes are regularly encountered in the recreational fishery). Since 2008, efforts have been made to improve anglers' species identification skills by distributing over 20,000 laminated groundfish identification guides and posters to CPFVs to improve compliance with species specific regulations.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Onboard observers record species of fish retained and discarded for a subset of anglers along each drift. Comparisons of the discard rates calculated from retained and discarded catch estimates to those calculated from onboard sampling observations of the composition of retained and discarded fish tallied by the observer the actual discard of squarespot by up to a factor of 3. Two model sensitivities to discard rates were performed: 1) increasing the discard by a factor of 3 (the average disard rate across years 2005-2016) applied to the entire timeseries; 2) Increase discards by a factor of 10.5 through 2008 (based on the average discard rate from 2005-2008), after which discards are increased by 2.7 (based on the average discard rate from 2009-2016).

Length data (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}) for retained recreational catches sourced by MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2020) were downloaded from the RecFIN website. The lengths of discarded fish measured by samplers onboard CPFVs prior to being released (Type 3d data) from 2003 to 2020 were also downloaded from the RecFIN website. The number of length observations by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:rec-len}. The highest samples by year occurred within the last 16 years of the modeled period. The recreational lengths provide little information regarding recruitment strength in the length data as only the largest individuals (with a broad range of unknown age) are taken (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). The mean size observed ranged between about 20 to 25 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-data}). The small size of squarespot rockfish and typical hook size used in the recreational fishery likely limits the ability of hook and line gear to observe smaller fish. Input sample sizes were assumed equal to the number of length samples available by year.

Three additional length compostion data sets sampling the CPFV fishery were made available after the original stock assessment review: 1. 1975-1978 (Collins and Crooke CPFV onboard observer survey) 2. 1986-1989 (Alley and Ono CPFV onboard observer survey) 3. 1987-1998 (Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV onboard observer survey)

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

These data sets were extensively analyzed after the initial stock assessment review, with results presented to the Groundfish Subcommittee of the Scientific and Statistical Committee. The first two were more relevant than the third that sampled the tail end of the squarespot range, and showed no influecen on the model when included. There were significnat questions on the basic lack of fit to the first two data sets that resulted in large affects on model output. These data were ultimately not included in the base model, and should be evaluated further (both examining possible species identification issues and whether number of fish or trips should be used for effective sample sizes) before including in future squarespot rockfish stock assessments.

The commercial removals for squarespot rockfish are extremely sparse throughout the time series (Figure \ref{fig:twofleetcatch}). The small size of squarespot rockfish individuals makes squarespot rockfish an undesirable fish to market and to capture by trawl or commercial hook and line gears. Its affinity for rocky reefs also makes it difficult to access with trawl gear. Commercial landings prior to 1969 were queried through the SWFSC California Catch Reconstruction database {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into `trawl,' `non-trawl,' and `unknown' gear categories. Commercial landings between 1969 - 1980 were queried from the CALCOM database. Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database, extracted 22 February, 2021.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The historical commercial discard mortality was calculated based on the average discard rates from WCGOP of 28 percent and used to adjust the landings data from 1916 to 2001 to account for total removals.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Given the extremely small commercial landings and minimal sampling of lengths (see below), the recreational and commercial catches were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}).

The annual length samples from the commercial fishery were quite limited (Table \ref{tab:com-len}). The limited sizes observed were generally between 20 - 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:comm-mean-len-data} and Figure \ref{fig:bubble-comm-len-data}). Given the small number of samples by year and the lack of commercial catches in the removal time series, the commerical removals were added to the recreational samples and the commercial lengths were excluded from the reference model.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

A sensitivity to using 2 fleets (commerical and recreational) as opposed to a combined 1 fleet was explored. This scenario separated the removals into two fleets and used the limited commerical lengths to estimate commerical selectivity.

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfishes (genus \emph{Sebastes}) at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure \ref{fig:hkl-sites}) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the \gls{s-hkl} are bocaccio (\emph{S. paucispinis}), cowcod (\emph{S. levis}), greenspotted (\emph{S. chlorostictus}), and vermilion/sunset (\emph{S. miniatus} and \emph{S. crocotulus}) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(J. Harms, Benante, and Barnhart 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Squarespot rockfish have been observed at multiple sampling sites by the \Gls{s-hkl} each year between 2004 - 2019 (Table \ref{tab:hkl-len}). The number of positive observations increased sharply starting in 2014 which coincided with when the \gls{s-hkl} began sampling sites located within the Cowcod Conservation Area (CCA, Figure \ref{fig:hkl-cca}). The increased observation rate starting in 2014 appeared to occur both outside and inside the CCA, rather than being due to the commencement of sampling within the CCA. The increased observations of squarespot rockfish outside the CCA indicates that this change may be driven by recent strong year classes rather than a change in sampling location (John Harms, NOAA NWFSC, pers. comm.).

The squarespot rockfish observed by the \Gls{s-hkl} are primarily mature females which is likely due to the small size of male squarespot rockfish, competition among other rockfishes, and hook size (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-data}). The mean size of fish observed by the \Gls{s-hkl} has been relatively stable (Figure \ref{fig:mean-hkl-len-data}). The small size of squarespot rockfish may also make it an inconsistently collected species in this survey, but it was considered worth evaluating an index of abundance. The input sample sizes of lengths that accompany the survey samples were set equal to the number of length samples available by year.

An annual index of abundance was calculated from the \Gls{s-hkl} data following the methods put forth in Harms et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} based on the AIC criterion. The index of abundance was calculated using a binomial generalized-linear model. The final index includes year, site, number of hooks, fisher, drop number, and moon fullness (as a polynomial) as covariates. The single index of abundance was calculated using both observation outside and within the CCA (Table \ref{tab:hkl-index-vals} and Figure \ref{fig:hkl-index}). The index of abundances was low and relatively flat until 2014 when the index sharply increases, hitting a high in 2018. There seems to be no significant difference between indices that include or exclude samples from the CCA (Figure \ref{fig:mean-hkl-len-data}).

The \gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Bradburn, Keller, and Horness 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The \gls{s-wcgbt} has observed squarespot rockfish each year of the survey, however, the number of positive tows are limited (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts-len}). Since the \Gls{s-wcgbt} uses trawl gear to sample sandy bottom areas off the West Coast, it is not expected to be an informative data source for squarespot rockfish which are small and closely associated with rock substrate. The limited tows by year where squarespot rockfish were observed within this area, preventing the calculation of an index of abundance using spatial temporal methods (e.g., VAST) for squarespot rockfish. A design-based index calculated resulted in high variability and uncertainty by year (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbts-dbindex}). With limited length observations and in the absence of a VAST index of abundance to link these data to, this data set was not used in the base model.

The CalCOFI survey is an egg and larval survey of primarily southern California waters (though it has expanded northward over time) using a fixed station design. This survey began in 1949, but more recently it has started to process rockfish larvae to the species level using genetic analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thompson et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Tissue samples were collected in all years, but suffered from degradation before 1997, so the time series of species-identified larvae begins in 1997 and ends in 2013 (the year of the last genetic analysis). Squarespot rockfish is one of the more prominently identified rockfish species in this data set. A time series of mean squarespot larvel abundance per year was provided by the lead researcher (A. Thompson), with a CV of 0.4 assumed for each year. This time series can be used as an index of spawning biomass using index option 30 in Stock Synthesis. This time series is not included in the reference model, but it is added as a sensitivity to its inclusion in the model.

Males are smaller than females, but much less susceptible to capture by hook and line, so the trawl fishery provided an important source of small individuals. Figure \ref{fig:len-age} shows the lengths and ages for all years by data source as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data.

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used.

The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} functional regression model and is a commonly applied method for west coast groundfish.

We assumed the age of 45 years to represent the practical longevity for both females and males based on 90\% of the age of the oldest sampled individual (a 50 year old female; oldest male was 49), as was done in the 2015 yelloweye assessement {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Gertseva and Cope 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Empirical {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimators using the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were also considered (Figure \ref{fig:M_female}), but they produced unreasonably high estimates (2-3 times higher than the longevity estimates). This is likely explained by the fact that while squarespot rockfish are a smaller rockfish species, they still have protracted longevity comparable to stocks that are twice their maximum size. Additionally, the FishLife {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson, Munch, et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimate was included, though, given the source of FishLife data is FishBase, there is a good chance the estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} are also from methods using longevity, though the actual value of longevity used was unknown. The final composite {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} distributionn (Figure \ref{fig:M_composite_dists}) are based on 4 empirical estimators, and result in a median value of 0.133 (mean of 0.136), with a CV of 0.22. We explore sensitivity to these assumptions of natural mortality through likelihood profiling.

The model assumes a ``data-moderate'' category 2 approach, meaning removal histories, length compositions and fishery-independent abundancies are the approved data inputs. Other data types (e.g., ages) can be used external to the assessment model to inform parameter values. The squarespot rockfish model assessment assumes a single removal fleet (mainly recreational that includes the very small commercial catches) with removals beginning in 1916. The NWFSC Hook and Line survey is the one fishery-independant data source used to measure abundance trends. Selectivities for the fleet and survey were specified using the double normal parameterization within SS where selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic with the ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters estimated. Life history parameters are sex-specific, with one growth type, and assumed stationary. Recruitment assumes a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship and is deterministic.

Sensitivity scenarios and likelihood profiles were used to explore uncertainty in the values of the natural mortality and growth parameters.

Initial sample sizes for the recreational length compositions and NWFSC Hook and Line survey were based on the number of fish sampled. The method of Francis ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, equation TA1.8) was then used to balance the length composition data among other data inputs and likelihood components. The Francis method treats mean length as an index, with effective sample size defining the variance around the mean. If the variability around the mean does not encompass model predictions, the length data should be down-weighted until predictions fit within the intervals. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution), but can be sensitive to years that are outliers, as the amount of down-weighting is applied to all years within a data source, and are not year-specific. Sensitivities were performed examining different data-weighting treatments: 1) the Dirichlet-Multinomial approach {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson, Johnson, et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, 2) the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean approach {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(McAllister and Ianelli 1997)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, or 3) no data-weighting of lengths.

The base assessment model for squarespot rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory and realtive stock status for the population of squarespot rockfish in federal waters off California. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses different data types and sources to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model. These include considerations of model structure, data and parameter treatment, estimation phasing, and jittered starting values to achieve a converged and balanced model that provides sensible parameter estimates and derived quantities.

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.1. This was repeated 100 times with 92 out of 100 runs returned to the reference model likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:jitter_01}). Another exploration using a jitter shift at 0.2 was used, but it returned 94 out of 100 runs equal to the reference model. A better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of these runs. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made.

Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Annual length composition fits are shown in {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix B}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Pearson residuals of the fishery length data are generally low with no distinct pattern of misfitting (Figure \ref{fig:rec-com-pearson}). Despite the lack of recruitment estimation, there are no obvious patterns of missed recruitment. Fits to the fishery mean lengths, assuming Francis data-weighting, show a relatively stable mean length index, with a drop in size in the most recent years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-com-mean-len-fit}). This observed decline in mean lengths was well fit despite the rigid nature (e.g., few estimated parameters and deterministic recruitment) of the model.

Pearson residuals for the survey data are larger than the better sampled fishery data, but in general also do not present any distinct residual pattern (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-pearson}). Largest residuals were with male samples at bigger sizes, where the model assumed fewer males were expected than observed, though those males are exceptionally large (near 30 cm) given there asymptotic size of \textless22 cm . This discrepancy, outside the issue with Pearson residuals being sensitive to small samples, could also be due to either sex-misidentification or the need for a higher CV at length for males, though is not a major source of uncertainty in the squarespot rockfish assessment. Fits to the survey mean lengths (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-mean-len-fit}) again support relatively stable mean lengths with littel contrast. The male lengths provide little information on stock status, as only the largest males near {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} are taken. The female data, from which the spawning stock status is measured, provides more information as mean length is below, but included in the uncertainty of, the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} value.

Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The model fits the aggregate lengths for the unsexed fishery fleet and survey female length data well, with an acceptable, but noticeabley poorer fit to the male survey lengths. The biologically smaller males are encountered with much less frequency given the selectivity of the hook and line gear, and thus males samples sizes are much smaller and sporadic over time compared to the other data sources. This leads to spiky and less resolved length compositions, though the overall fit is reasonable under the circumstances. The mode of the aggregate female lengths is larger than the unsexed fishery data, though given the lack of sex-specific fishery lengths and prominent sex-specific growth, it is not apparent whether the Hook-and-Line survey acutally catches bigger fish than the recreational fishery.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The fit to the Hook and Line survey index is generally poor, as the index is much more dynamic and indicative of a general increase in the most recent few years (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-index-fit}). This opposes the trend in the fishery and survey lengths mostly showing a small decrease in the most recent years. The survey values are very low and the CVs are intially large (30-40\% CV), but the model adds twice as much variance (0.85), limiting the influence of the survey in the model. Given the competition for hook space with bigger individuals and the geographically limited sampling of squarespot rockfish habitat, this result is not unreasonable.

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. Estimated spawning output shows a large decline starting in the 1970s, with a continued decline into the 1980s. This tracks the large removals during this time period. A large decline in removals starting in the mid-1980s and into the 1990s is reflected in a population that begins a steady increase into the early 2010s. Recent high removals (the largest in the recorded removal history) have again caused a stark population decline. The estimate of total biomass over time, which tracks that of spawning output, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

Relative spawning output declined below the management target ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) in the early 1980s and again fell below the target starting in 2019 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The relative stock status at the start of 2021 is estimated to be below the rockfish relative biomass target of 40 percent (0.37) but above the management threshold of 25 percent. Uncertainty intervals indicate the population never goes below the management limit ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{25\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) and is near the target after a very low catch in 2020 (likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic).

The decision to allow the model to find a compromised fit between the weighted length data and the Hook and Line survey index via added variance on the index showed the largest relative change. A model that did not downweight the Hook and Line index showed a more optimistic relative spawning output, with the scale of the population outside the confidence intervals of the reference model (Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}). The scaleless length-only model provides a very similar estimate of final relative spawning output to the reference model (36.9\% vs 37.5\%), thus showing the influence of the length information. The scenario that removes all lengths resulted in a lower relative stock size, but has nothing to inform the removal selectivity, thus the results are highly dependent on the starting values of an unstable model.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Data-weighting choice had very little influence on model output. This also highlights that the simple fleet structure, limited additional data types, and fixed life history parameters puts a focus on the signal contained in the fishery length data. There was little influence in any derived quantities when adding three times more discards in the contemporary time frame (Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}). There was a little more sensitivity in the population scale adding 10 times more discards prior to 2009. This is a typical results when the catch history is adjusted upwards, which simply scales the popualtion size up as well. The model also added a little less variance to the Hook and Line index (Table \ref{tab:data_sensis}), but in general even adding 10 times more discards had very little impact in model results. Overall, the effects of all these data treatments are small.

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Tables \ref{tab:modspec_LH_sensis} and \ref{tab:modspec_RecMisc_sensis}.

Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-RE}. Time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-ssb} and \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-depl}.

Life history estimation involving female growth values tended to increase stock scale and current relative stock status, while male estimation tended to drop the estimate of unfished stock size, with slight overall increases in current relative stock status.

A reference model that included recruitment estimation (assuming {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma_R\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.6) was under consideration, but the model showed very little information in estimating recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mod-var}). This is unsurprising given the fishery only takes the largest females, thus selectivity greatly weakens any recruitment signal. Estimating recruitment caused stock scale to decrease to around the bottom end of the reference model confidence intervals, but with a slight decrease in relative stock status. Downweighting the survey, as done in the reference model, causes the current biomass to increase with a significant increase in relative stock status.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Breaking the fishery data into two fleets made little difference, thus supporting the parsimony of using one fleet. Hypothesizing five growth platoons instead of just one led to the notable result of higher stock scale and relative stock status. This approach causes two of five proposed female growth platoons to be below and two above the average (i.e., equivalent to the reference model) growth response. Given the fishery only takes the largest individuals, the smaller growth platoons are no longer available to the fishery, thus the population gains overall stock size and relative stock status.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The two dome-shaped selectivity scenarios are subsets of a larger exploration of dome-shaped selectivity requested after the first stock assessment review. Estimating dome-shaped selectivity after 2001 shifts the ascending selectivity to the right and a drop in selectivity before the size at {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, resulting in a selectivity curve that full captures only a very restricted portion of length classes (Figure \ref{fig:dome-shaped}). This protection of the majority of the lengths after 2001 increases cryptic biomass and thereore results in a much more optimistic estimate of stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:Comp-ref-domes}). It also leads to huge increases in uncertainty of these derived quantities. Given biological parameters and recruiment deviations are not estimated, this huge increase in uncertainty is indicative of a lack of ability for the model to estimate selectivity parameters. It is also expected that the asymptotic version of the model would be at the lower limit of the uncertainty envelop, as it represents a boundary condition (i.e., one cannot select more than 100\% of any length class). This uncertinaty grows if both periods are allowed to be selectivity. These results indicate the lack of capacity of the model to freely estimate dome-shaped selectivity, thus the decision to retain the default of asymptotic selectivity was retained.

Overall, there were no model specification sensitivity scenarios that caused the population to drop significantly below the reference model estimate of stock status. If stock scale differed, unfished stock size had the biggest uncertainty and was usually less than the reference model, excepting the hypothesis of five growth platoons.

Likelihood profiles were conducted for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(log(R_0)\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, steepness ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), female and male natural mortality ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) values separately and varying together, female and male maximum length ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), female and male growth coefficient ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), female and male variability of size at maximum age. In addition, joint profiles over {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} (that maintains a -0.9 correlation structure between the parameters) were done for females and males separately as well as for female and male natural mortality. Likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the featured parameter(s) at specific values across a range of values and estimating the remaining parameters. A likelihood profile offers insight into model information on a given parameter or parameter pairing, while providing an additional way to describe uncertainty in the parameter by indentifying the range of parameters within 1.96 likelihood units of the refrence model.

The {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(log(R_0)\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} profiles show strong support for the maximum likelhood value of 5.94 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile-combo}). Population size expectedly increases as {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(log(R_0)\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} increases, with the increase in current biomass happening quicker than initial biomass, thus relative stock status increase towards unfished at high {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(log(R_0)\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values. This is explained by the harvest rate decreasing because the removal history is fixed and becomes relatively smaller compared to the overall biomass. Length data dominated the information content in the profile, with the index indicating a higher {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(log(R_0)\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, partially explaining the increased stock status when the index is given more weight.l

The steepness profile showed data supported values from 0.45 to 1, with ranges of relative stock status from 30\% to 40\% (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile-combo}). {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} showed the biggest change across steepness values, though the most informed portion of the profile did not change greatly. Length data dominated the information in the profile (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile-combo}).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Natural mortality profiles for females (Figure \ref{fig:M_f-profile-combo}) and males (Figure \ref{fig:M_m-profile-combo}) highlight two important issues: 1) the inability for the data in this model to inform either of these parameters and 2) model derived values are sensitive to the value, mainly female {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Natural mortality values at the minimum likelihood values either goes toward unrealistically high (Figure \ref{fig:M_f-profile-combo}) or low (Figure \ref{fig:M_m-profile-combo}) {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values. The combined profile that varies female and male {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} together at the same changing value behave diretionally most like the female likelihood, though with less change across values (Figure \ref{fig:M-multiprofile-combo}). Scale and relative stock status are most affected by the assumption of females rather than male {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, as the females interact the most with the fishery.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Female growth profiles show a similar lack of information to estimate {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, or CV at maximum age. Length compositions support a smaller {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} when {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is fixed (Figure \ref{fig:Linf_F-profile-combo}) and a lower {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} when {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is fixed (Figure \ref{fig:k_f-profile-combo}). A more realistic profile maintains the negative correlation bewtween {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} showing the lower {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} value is preferred over a lower k value (Figure \ref{fig:Linf_k_f-profile}). Changing either value has a large affect on stock scale and relative stock status. The profile over the variability at maximum age supported a lower value than in the model (Figure \ref{fig:CVold_f-profile-combo}). The lower values increased overall popluation size (particularly current biomass) and derived a noticeably higher current relative stock status.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Male growth profiles showed more information and less overall sensitivity than the female profiles. Length compositions from the fishery and survey strongly supported a slightly larger {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} when {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is fixed (Figure \ref{fig:Linf_M-profile-combo}) and a much higher {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} when {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is fixed (Figure \ref{fig:k_m-profile-combo}), though there is essentially no information in estimating male {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Relative stock status changes little across {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values, but the population scale change is more pronounced. The joint {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}-{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} profile showing the higher {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} value is preferred over a higher k value (Figure \ref{fig:Linf_k_m-profile}). Changing either value has a relatively small affect on stock scale and relative stock status. Overall, the influence of male growth values is smaller than females. The model supported values of the variability at maximum age between 0.1 and 0.14 (Figure \ref{fig:CVold_f-profile-combo}). Larger values decreased overall popluation size a little, with more of an affect on the more recent biomass estimates, and had only small affect on relative stock status.

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model and sequentially removing one year of data. Retrospective spawning output estimates were gnerally within the confidence intervals of the reference model (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}), which also lead to consistent estimates of stock status among the retrospective scenarios, with no strong pattern (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}).

A salient aspect of the squarespot rockfish stock assessment is how much the female portion of the population is affected by the fishery.

A ten year projection of the reference model with removals in 2021 and 2022 equal to the recent average removals from 2017-2019 were run based on the category 2 time-varying buffer using {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(P^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.45 for years 2023-2032 is provided in Table \ref{tab:project}.

The decision table (Table \ref{tab:dec-tab}) was constructed using natural mortality values (females and males assumed equivalent) to define the low and high states of nature. The likelihood profile of natural mortality was insufficent to capture undertainty in the base model. Natural mortality values for the staetes of nature were instead established by using the commonly applied lognormal treatment when estimating this parameter, with the mean (0.133, fixed in the base model) and standard deviation (0.438, a common default estimate of natural mortality uncertainty based on Hamel (2015)) used to find natural mortality values corresponding to the 12.5\% and 87.5\% quantiles (standard quantiles used in west coast decision tables). These values were 0.0804 and 0.22 for the low and high states of nature, respectively.

Squarespot rockfish is a relatively data-limited rockfish. More research and data collection would improve future assessments and address some sources of uncertainty. Below is a list of specific suggestions for future research:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  More age and length data would continue to improve growth estimates, especially for females, and allow for the estimation of growth within the model.

\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  The maturity estimate used is old (30+ years ago) and was missing both the slope parameter or estimate of 95\% maturity. An updated measure of functional maturity that gives a more complete consideration of the length or age-based maturity would be a major improvement.

  \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend
\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  More work on dead discard estimates in recreational fisheries could benefit multiple rockfish species, especially smaller-sized species that are more prone to being thrown back and unidentified.

  \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend
\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  The Hook and Line survey proved questionable for squarespot given their size. A survey for squarespot may be difficult to design given their small size and depths. Smaller hook size or other considerations will need to be evaluated in the event a survey for smaller rockfishes is desireable.

  \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend
\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  Hyperstability in length composition data (i.e., only catching the biggest individuals, thus unable to detect a decrease in relative stock size) should be explored via simulation testing in order to understand when catch and length models could suffer from the lack of contrast needed to detect stocks status.

Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. We are very grateful to all the agers at the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Jason Jannot and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. Peter Frey and John Harms were incredibly helpful in facilitating the understanding of the STAT team as to why and when each of our assessments either encounter or do not squarespot rockfish along the coast. John Wallace provided the work-up of the Hook and Line survey.

All of the data moderate assessment assessments this year were greatly benefited by the numerous individuals who took the time to participate in the pre-assessment data webinar. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, and Daniel Platt were provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the West Coast of the U.S. which were essential in the production of all of the squarespot rockfish assessments conducted this year.
