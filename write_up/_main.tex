This assessment reports the status of squarespot rockfish (\emph{Sebastes hopkinsi}) off the U.S. West Coast using data through 2020. Squarespot rockfish is a small bodied rockfish found from Mexico to southern Oregon, with a core distribution in southern California. This species is treated as one stock, as there is no evidence of population structure.

Squarespot rockfish are commonly found in depths between 60 - 119 meters, hovering over or sheltering in rocky reef habitat and aggregating with other smaller rockfishes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Squarespot rockfish are yellow-brown, brown, or tan on the back and sides with lighter colored bellies. Squarespot rockfish is a dwarf species of rockfish with dimorphic growth between the sexes. Female squarespot rockfish reach larger sizes compared to males, with females reaching maximum sizes around 29 cm.

Squarespot rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Shelf Rockfish South and North complexes. The North and South areas are split at N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. While squarespot rockfish is included in the Shelf Rockfish North complex, the contribution from squarespot rockfish is extremely low (\textless{} 0.5 mt) because the vast majority of the distribution of the stock is in the southern region of California. The Shelf Rockfish complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The complex OFLs and ACLs are determined by summing the species specific OFLs and ACLs managed within the complex. Removals for species within the Shelf Rockfish complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The commercial removals for squarespot rockfish were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl', and `unknown' gear categories. Commercial landing between 1969 - 1980 were queried from the CALCOM database. Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database, extracted XX, 2021.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data between 1916 to 2001 to account for total removals was calculated based on the average discard rates from WCGOP of 28 percent.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The annual length samples from the commercial fishery was limited (Table \ref{tab:com-len}). The sizes observed were generally between 20 - 30 cm (Figure XX). Given the limited number of samples by year the bubble sizes are not do not allow interpretation of size frequency. Figure XX shows the mean size by year observed.

The recreational removals prior to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Recreational removals from 1980 - 1989 were obtained from MRFSS and 1993-2020 were obtained from RecFIN. Both data sources provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus discarded fish. The missing years between the MRFSS and RecFIN data years, 1990-1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1992 values. The MRFSS and RecFIN removals included landings plus estimated discards. For years prior to 1980 a historical discard rate of 26.7 percent was assumed based on Miller and Gotshall {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1965)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Length samples were available from the recreational fishery from 1983 - 2020 with the largest sample sizes in the 1,000 since 2013. (Table \ref{tab:rec-len}). The lengths observd by the recreational fishery were generally between 20 - 30 cm (Figure XX). The small size of squarespot rockfish and hook size likely limits the ability of hook and line gear to observe smaller fish. The mean length by year ranged between 20 - 24 cm (Figure XX).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus \emph{Sebastes} at fixed stations (e.g., sites) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the \Gls{s-hkl} are bocaccio (\emph{S. paucispinis}), cowcod (\emph{S. levis}), greenspotted (\emph{S. chlorostictus}), and vermilion (\emph{S. miniatus} and \emph{S. crocotulus}) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Harms, Benante, and Barnhart 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Squarespot rockfish have been observed at multiple sampling site by the \Gls{s-hkl} survey each year between 2004 - 2019 (Table \ref{tab:hkl-len}). The number of positive observations has increased sharply starting in 2014 which coincided with the \Gls{s-hkl} began sampling sites located within the cowcod conservation area (CCA, Figure \ref{fig:hkl-cca}). Squarespot rockfish have been observed both outside and inside the CCA and the increased observation rate starting in 2014 appeared to occur both outside and inside the CCA. The increased observations of squarespot rockfish both inside and outside the CCA indicates that this change may be driven by recent strong year classes rather than a change in sampling location (John Harms, NOAA NWFSC, pers. comm.).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The squarespot rockfish observed by the \Gls{s-hkl} are primarily mature females which is likely due to the small size of male squarespot rockfish, competition among other rockfishes, and hook size (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-data}). The mean size of fish observed by the \Gls{s-hkl} has been relatively stable (Figure \ref{fig:mean-hkl-len-data}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

An annual index of abundance was calculated from the \Gls{s-hkl} data following the methods put forth in Harms et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} based on the AIC criterion. The index of abundance was calculated using a binomial generalized-linear model. The final index includes year, site, number of hooks, fisher, drop number, and moon fullness (as a polynomial) as covariates. The single index of abundance was calculated using both observation outside and within the CCA (Table \ref{tab:hkl-index-vals} and Figure \ref{fig:hkl-index}). The index of abundances was low and relatively flat until 2014 when the index sharply increases, hitting a high in 2018.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The input sample sizes were calculated equal to the number of length samples available by year.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Bradburn, Keller, and Horness 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} has observed squarespot rockfish each year of the survey, however, the number of positive tows are limited (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts-len}). Sine the \Gls{s-wcgbt} uses trawl gear to sample sandy bottom areas off the West Coast, \emph{apriori} it would not be expected to be an informative data source for squarespot rockfish which are closely associated with rock substrate. The limited tows by year where squarespot rockfish were observed within this area, preventing the calculation of an index of abundance using spatial temporal methods (e.g., VAST) for squarespot rockfish. A design-based index calculated resulted in high variability and uncertainty by year (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbts-dbindex}). With limited length observations and in the absence of a VAST index of abundance to link these data to, this data set was not used in the base model.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Although these data were not directly used in the assessment, data from this survey were used to develop life history parameters. The \Gls{s-wcgbt} captured smaller fish relative to \Gls{s-hkl} with both males and females observed (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbts-len-data}). Samples collected by the \Gls{s-wcgbt} were used to estimate sex specific length-at-weight, length-at-age parameters, and to determine a prior value for natural mortality (see the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{biological_data}{Biological Data}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} section below for more information).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In that same issue of \emph{ICES Journal of Marine Science}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} provided an updated data set of estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The approach of basing {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} by fitting the one-parameter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), the point estimate for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and SE = 0.438. Using a maximum age of 34, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.159 per year The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources. The oldest aged rockfish was 50 years with a single observations, off the coast of California captured by the NWFSC Hook and Line survey in 2015. However, age data are subject to ageing error which could impact this estimate of longevity. The selection of 34 years was based on the 97.5 quantile of all observed ages. The assumption of a maximum age of 34 years differs from a literature maximum age of 19 years for squarespot rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Sensitivities will be conducted examining the impact of natural mortality assumptions.

Squarespot rockfish was assessed using a two-sex model with sex specific life history parameters. The model assumed two fishing fleets: 1) commercial and 2) recreational fleets with removals beginning in 1916. Two fishery-independant data sources were also used: 1) NWFSC Hook and Line and 2) NWFSC WCGBT surveys. Selectivities for all fleets, removal and survey fleets, were specified using the double normal parameterization within SS where selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic with the ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters estimated. Annual recruitment deviations were allowed to vary by year.

Prior were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model. A prior distribution was developed for natural mortality ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) using the Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 34 years. The prior assumed a lognormal distribution for natural mortality. The lognormal prior has a median of 0.159 and a standard error of 0.438.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The prior for steepness ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) assumed a beta distribution with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\mu\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.72 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.15.\\
The prior parameters are based on the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absense of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

The base assessment model for squarespot rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of squarespot rockfish off the California coast. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by XX\%. This was repeated 100 times with XX out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

We are very grateful to all the agers at WDFW, ODFW, and the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Jason Jannot and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. Peter Frey and John Harms were incredibly helpful in facilitating the understanding of the STAT team as to why and when each of our assessments either encounter or do not squarespot rockfish along the coast.

All of the data moderate assessment assessments this year were greatly benefited by the numerous individuals who took the time to participate in the pre-assessment data webinar. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, and Daniel Platt were provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the West Coast of the U.S. which were essential in the production of all of the squarespot rockfish assessments conducted this year.
