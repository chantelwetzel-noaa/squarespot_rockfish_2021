## Biological Data

### Natural Mortality

Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. In that same issue of *ICES Journal of Marine Science*, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] provided an updated data set of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}$. The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and SE = 0.438. Using a maximum age of 34, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.159 per year  The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources. The oldest aged rockfish was 50 years with a single observations, off the coast of California captured by the NWFSC Hook and Line survey in 2015.  However, age data are subject to ageing error which could impact this estimate of longevity.  The selection of 34 years was based on the 97.5 quantile of all observed ages. The assumption of a maximum age of 34 years differs from a literature maximum age of 19 years for  `r spp` [@love_milton_probably_1996].  Sensitivities will be conducted examining the impact of natural mortality assumptions.

### Length-Weight Relationship

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using all coastwide biological data available from fishery-independent data sources. The estimated length-weight for female fish was `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ where $L$ is length in cm (Figures \ref{fig:len-weight}).


### Growth (Length-at-Age)

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp` using data collected from fishery-independent data sources off the coast of California that were collected from 2004-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps} and Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). Figure \ref{fig:len-age} shows the lengths and ages for all years by data source as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1[1], 3)`

Males $L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1[1], 3)`

\end{centering}

The length-at-age by sex and the coefficient of variation by size used in the model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.



### Maturation and Fecundity

Maturity-at-length based on the work of XXX which estimated the 50 percent size-at-maturity of `r round(model$MGparmAdj[,"Mat50%_Fem_GP_1"][1],2)` cm and slope of `r round(model$MGparmAdj$Mat_slope_Fem_GP_1[1], 2)` off the coast of California with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).  

The fecundity-at-length was based on research Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. The fecundity relationship for `r spp` was estimated equal to `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.
