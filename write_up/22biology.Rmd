## Biological Parameters

### Growth (Length-at-Age)

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp` using data collected from fishery-independent data sources off the coast of California that were collected from 2004-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps} and Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). Figure \ref{fig:len-age} shows the lengths and ages for all years by data source as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1[1], 3)`; $t{\0}$ = `r round(model$Growth_Parameters[1,10], 2)`

Males $L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1[1], 3)`; $t{\0}$ = `r round(model$Growth_Parameters[2,10], 2)`

\end{centering}

The length-at-age by sex and the coefficient of variation by size used in the model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.



### Maturation and Fecundity

Maturity-at-length based on the work of Love et al [-@love_life_1990] which estimated the 50 percent size-at-maturity of `r round(model$MGparmAdj[,"Mat50%_Fem_GP_1"][1],2)` cm off the coast of California, however, the slope of the maturity curve was not estimated. In the abscense of a literature value an intermediat slope of `r round(model$MGparmAdj$Mat_slope_Fem_GP_1[1], 2)` was assumed. Maturity was assumed to asymptote to 1.0 for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).  

The fecundity-at-length was based on research Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. The fecundity relationship for `r spp` was estimated equal to `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.


### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality was not directly measures, so instead relied on life-history based empirical relationships. We applied the Natural Mortality Tool (NMT; https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool), a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity. The NMT currently provives 19 options, including the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] functional regression model and is commomly applied method for west coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted by user. 

Initial exploration used the longevity estimate of 45 years based on 90% of the age of the oldest sampled individual (a 50 year old male). Males are smaller than females, but much less susceptible to capture. So while it might be expected that males could have a higher natural mortality than females, the oldest aged female was 33 and collected after years of exploitation. We therefore assumed the age of 45 years to represent the practical longevity for both females and males. Methods using the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were also considered (Figure \ref{fig:M_female}), but they produced unreasonably high estimates (2-3 times higher than the longevity estimates). This is likely explained by the fact that while Squarespot rockfish are a smaller rockfish species, they still have protracted longevity comparable to stocks that are twice the maximum size. Additionally, the FishLife tool [@thorson_predicting_2017] estimate was included, though, given the source of FishLife data is FishBase, there is a good chance the estimates of M are also from longevity estimates, but from an unknown longevity estimate. The final composite distributionn (Figure \ref{fig:M_composite_dists}) are based on 4 empirical estimators, and result in a median value of 0.133 (mean of 0.136), with a CV of 0.22, demonstrating high coherence among the four estimators. We explore sensitivity to these assumptions of natural mortality.    


### Length-Weight Relationship

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using all coastwide biological data available from fishery-independent data sources. The estimated length-weight for female fish was `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ where $L$ is length in cm (Figures \ref{fig:len-weight}).



### Sex Ratio

`r Spp` exhibit dimorphic growth by sex with the males (`r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1[1], 1)` cm) reaching smaller sizes compared to females (`r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1[1], 1)` cm). Given the relatively small size of full grown `r spp` males, observations were limited across data sources.  In the absence of evidence to assume otherwise, the sex ratio at birth was assumed to be 50:50 by sex.
