## Uncertainty exploration


### Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model sensitivity to alternative data treatment and model specifications.

#### Data treatment sensitivities

Data treatments explored were as follows:
\begin{enumerate} 

  \item Fishery length data only (no catches)

  \item Remove fishery length data

  \item No survey data

  \item No extra variance estimated for the survey

  \item Dirichlet data-weighting

  \item McAllister-Ianelli data weighting

  \item No data-weighting

  \item Alternative discards: 3x the amount of discards 

  \item Alternative discards: lower discards after 2008
  

\end{enumerate}



Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}. Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb}, \ref{fig:sens-depl}, and \ref{fig:sens-recdev}.

#### Model specification sensitivities

Model specifications looked at the estimation of indiviual and combinations of life history parameters, the estimation of recruitment, and the use of two fleets (commercial and recreational) instead of one, and the hypothesis of 5 growth platoons instead of 1. Each of the 5 life history estimation model specifications listed below were done for both sexes, just females and just males, for a total of 15 scenarios. All scenarios match the reference model in all other aspects unless otherwised stated.

1. Life history estimation
 	+ Estimate natural mortality ($M$)
  	+ Estimate $L_{\infty}$
  	+ Estimate $k$
  	+ Estimate $L_{\infty}$ and $k$
  	+ Estimate $M$, $L_{\infty}$ and $k$
  
2. Recruitment estimation and variability ($\sigma_R$). All years are estimated with bias correction applied.
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.45
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.6
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.75
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.6 with no extra variance

3. Miscellaneous
	+ 2 fleets (commerical and recreational instead of just one lumped fleet)
	+ 5 growth platoons instead of just one.



### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, female maximum length ($L_{infty}$), female growth coefficient ($k$), and female natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately a log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}).

(Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 

For steepness, values from approximately 0.30 to 1.0 were supported with the lowest negative log-likelihood occuring at the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}).

Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortatliy supported values greater than the fixed value of `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}).

Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb} and  \ref{fig:m-depl}. 

A profile across a range of female $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile})
Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb} and \ref{fig:linf-depl}.

A profile across a range of female $k$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:k-profile})

Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb} and \ref{fig:k-depl}.


### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.
