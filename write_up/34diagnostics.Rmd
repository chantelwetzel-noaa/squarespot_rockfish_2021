## Uncertainty exploration


### Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model sensitivity to alternative data treatment and model specifications.

#### Data treatment sensitivities

Data treatments explored were as follows:

1. Data removal
	+ Fishery length data only (no catches)
  	+ Remove fishery length data
  	+ No survey data
  	+ No extra variance estimated for the survey
2. Data weighting
  	+ Dirichlet data-weighting
  	+ McAllister-Ianelli data weighting
  	+ No data-weighting
3. Removal history
  	+ Alternative discards I: 3x the amount of discards 
  	+ Alternative discards II: lower discards after 2008
  

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:data_sensis}. Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}. Time series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sensi-data-ssb} and \ref{fig:sensi-data-depl}.

The decision to allow the model to find a compromised fit between the weighted length data and the Hook and Line survey index via added variance on the index showed the largest relative change. A model that did not downweight the Hook and Line index showed a more optimistic relative spawning biomass, with the scale of the population outside the confidence intervals of the reference model (Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}). The length-only model provides a very similar estimate of final relative spawning biomass to the reference model, thus showing the influence of this information. Data-weighting choice had very little influence in the model. This also highlights that the simple fleet structure, limited additional data types, and fixed life history parameters puts a focus on the signal contained in the fishery length data. There was little influence in any derived quantities when adding three times more discards in the contemporary time frame (Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}). There was a little more sensitivity to having changing the discard less from 2008 onward. While curious, that model added less variance to the Hook and Line index (Table \ref{tab:data_sensis}), thus adjusting the spawning biomass upwards similar to when not downweighting the index. Overall, the effects of these data treatments are small.


#### Model specification sensitivities

Model specifications looked at the estimation of indiviual and combinations of life history parameters, the estimation of recruitment, and the use of two fleets (commercial and recreational) instead of one, and the hypothesis of 5 growth platoons instead of 1. Each of the 5 life history estimation model specifications listed below were done for both sexes, just females and just males, for a total of 15 scenarios. All scenarios match the reference model in all other aspects unless otherwised stated.

1. Life history estimation
 	+ Estimate natural mortality ($M$)
  	+ Estimate $L_{\infty}$
  	+ Estimate $k$
  	+ Estimate $L_{\infty}$ and $k$
  	+ Estimate $M$, $L_{\infty}$ and $k$
  
2. Recruitment estimation and variability ($\sigma_R$). All years are estimated with bias correction applied.
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.45
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.6
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.75
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.6 with no extra variance

3. Miscellaneous
	+ 2 fleets (commerical and recreational instead of just one lumped fleet)
	+ 5 growth platoons instead of just one.

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Tables \ref{tab:modspec_LH_sensis} and \ref{tab:modspec_RecMisc_sensis}. Any attempt to estimate female $M$ and or $k$ led to unrealistic life history parameters estimates or population sizes (Table \ref{tab:modspec_LH_sensis}), so these runs are not included in the sensitivity figures in order to maintain an informative presentation. Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-RE}. Time series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-ssb} and \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-depl}.

Life history estimation involving female growth values tended to increase stock scale and current relative stock status, while male estimation tended to drop the estimate of unfished stock size, with slight overall increases in current relative stock status. Estimating recruitment caused stock scale to decrease to around the bottom end of the reference model confidence intervals, but with little difference in relative stock stauts. Downweighting the survey, like in the reference model, cause the current biomass to increase with a significant increase in relative stock status. Breaking the fishery data into two fleets made littel difference. Hypothesizing 5 growth platoons instead of just one led to the notable result of higher stock scale and relative stock status. This approach causes 2 of 5 female growth trajectories to be below the average growth response. Given the fishery only takes the largest individuals, the smaller growth platoons are no longer available to the fishery, thus the population gains overall stock size and relative stock status.

Overall, there were no model specification sensitivity scenarios that caused the population to drop significantly below the reference model estimate of stock status. If stock scale differed, it was often bigger in the unfished stock size and usually less than the reference model, excepting the hypothesis of 5 growth platoons.


### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, female and male maximum length ($L_{infty}$), female and male growth coefficient ($k$), and female and male natural mortality values separately. In addition, a joint profile over  $L_{infty}$ and $k$ were done for females and males separately. Likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the featured parameter at specific values across a range of values and estimating the remaining parameters. A likelihood profile offers insight into model information on a given parameter or parameter pairing, while providing an additional way to describe uncertainty in the parameter by indentifying the range of parameters within 1.96 likelihood units of the refrence model. 

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately a log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}).

(Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 

For steepness, values from approximately 0.30 to 1.0 were supported with the lowest negative log-likelihood occuring at the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}).  

Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}
Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortatliy supported values greater than the fixed value of `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}).

Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb} and  \ref{fig:m-depl}. 

A profile across a range of female $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile})
Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb} and \ref{fig:linf-depl}.

A profile across a range of female $k$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:k-profile})

Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb} and \ref{fig:k-depl}.


### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model and sequentially removing one year of data. Retrospective spawning biomass estimates were gnerally within the confidence intervals of the reference model (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}), which also lead to consistent estimates of stock status among the retrospective scenarios, with no strong pattern (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}).
