## Uncertainty exploration


### Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model sensitivity to alternative data treatment and model specifications.

#### Data treatment sensitivities

Data treatments explored were as follows:

1. Data removal
	+ Fishery length data only (no catches)
  	+ Remove fishery length data
  	+ No survey data
  	+ No extra variance estimated for the survey
2. Data weighting
  	+ Dirichlet data-weighting
  	+ McAllister-Ianelli data weighting
  	+ No data-weighting
3. Removal history
  	+ Alternative discards I: 3x the amount of discards 
  	+ Alternative discards II: lower discards after 2008
  

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:data_sensis}. Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}. Time series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sensi-data-ssb} and \ref{fig:sensi-data-depl}.

The decision to allow the model to find a compromised fit between the weighted length data and the Hook and Line survey index via added variance on the index showed the largest relative change. A model that did not downweight the Hook and Line index showed a more optimistic relative spawning biomass, with the scale of the population outside the confidence intervals of the reference model (Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}). The length-only model provides a very similar estimate of final relative spawning biomass to the reference model, thus showing the influence of this information. Data-weighting choice had very little influence in the model. This also highlights that the simple fleet structure, limited additional data types, and fixed life history parameters puts a focus on the signal contained in the fishery length data. There was little influence in any derived quantities when adding three times more discards in the contemporary time frame (Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}). There was a little more sensitivity to having changing the discard less from 2008 onward. While curious, that model added less variance to the Hook and Line index (Table \ref{tab:data_sensis}), thus adjusting the spawning biomass upwards similar to when not downweighting the index. Overall, these are small effects.


#### Model specification sensitivities

Model specifications looked at the estimation of indiviual and combinations of life history parameters, the estimation of recruitment, and the use of two fleets (commercial and recreational) instead of one, and the hypothesis of 5 growth platoons instead of 1. Each of the 5 life history estimation model specifications listed below were done for both sexes, just females and just males, for a total of 15 scenarios. All scenarios match the reference model in all other aspects unless otherwised stated.

1. Life history estimation
 	+ Estimate natural mortality ($M$)
  	+ Estimate $L_{\infty}$
  	+ Estimate $k$
  	+ Estimate $L_{\infty}$ and $k$
  	+ Estimate $M$, $L_{\infty}$ and $k$
  
2. Recruitment estimation and variability ($\sigma_R$). All years are estimated with bias correction applied.
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.45
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.6
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.75
	+ $\sigma_R$ = 0.6 with no extra variance

3. Miscellaneous
	+ 2 fleets (commerical and recreational instead of just one lumped fleet)
	+ 5 growth platoons instead of just one.



### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, female maximum length ($L_{infty}$), female growth coefficient ($k$), and female natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately a log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}).

(Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 

For steepness, values from approximately 0.30 to 1.0 were supported with the lowest negative log-likelihood occuring at the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}).  

Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}
Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortatliy supported values greater than the fixed value of `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}).

Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb} and  \ref{fig:m-depl}. 

A profile across a range of female $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile})
Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb} and \ref{fig:linf-depl}.

A profile across a range of female $k$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:k-profile})

Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb} and \ref{fig:k-depl}.


### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model and sequentially removing one year of data. Retrospective spawning biomass estimates were gnerally within the confidence intervals of the reference model (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}), which also lead to consistent estimates of stock status among the retrospective scenarios, with no strong pattern (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}).
