## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence



### Sensitivity Analyses


\begin{enumerate}

	\item Assume a natural mortality rate of 0.284 per year based on the oldest literature age of 19 years.
	
	\item Assume a natural mortality rate of 0.108 per year based on the oldest observed age of 50 years. 

	\item No recruitment deviations estimated (recruitment assumed deterministic).

\end{enumerate}



### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. 

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, maximum length, and female natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.
