## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery

The commercial removals for `r spp` were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, 'non-trawl', and 'unknown' gear categories. Commercial landing between 1969 - 1980 were queried from the CALCOM database. Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database, extracted XX, 2021. 

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards.  Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data between `r startyr` to 2001 to account for total removals was calculated based on the average discard rates from WCGOP of 28 percent. 

The annual length samples from the commercial fishery was limited (Table \ref{tab:com-len}).  The sizes observed were generally between 20 - 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). Given the limited number of samples by year the bubble sizes are not do not allow interpretation of size frequency. Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-data} shows the mean size by year observed.


### Recreational Fishery

State description of recreational removal data --- To be provided by John B. 

The recreational removals prior to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Recreational removals from 1980 - 1989 were obtained from MRFSS and 1993-2020 were obtained from RecFIN. Both data sources provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus discarded fish.  The missing years between the MRFSS and RecFIN data years, 1990-1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1992 values. The MRFSS and RecFIN removals included landings plus estimated discards. For years prior to 1980 a historical discard rate of 26.7 percent was assumed based on Miller and Gotshall [-@miller_ocean_1965].

Length samples were available from the recreational fishery from 1983 - 2020 with the largest sample sizes in the 1,000 since 2013. (Table \ref{tab:rec-len}). The lengths observd by the recreational fishery were generally between 20 - 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}).  The small size of `r spp` and hook size likely limits the ability of hook and line gear to observe smaller fish. The mean length by year ranged between 20 - 24 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-data}).
