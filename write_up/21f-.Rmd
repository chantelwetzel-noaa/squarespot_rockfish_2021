## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Recreational Fishery

#### Removals
The recreational removals prior to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Recreational removals from 1980 - 2003 were obtained from MRFSS and provide total mortality (observed landings plus dead discarded fish).  The missing years, 1990-1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1992 values. Removals years 2004 - 2020 were sampled by the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) and combine estimates of retained, dead discarded, and unreported landings. Both the MRFSS and CRFS reported removals were downloaded from RecFIN. 

Estimates of recreational discard mortality for the period from 2004 - 2020 are based on angler reported discards that can underestimate removals of less desirable species. Underestimation may occur because recall of encounters with undesirable species can be low, as well as indentification issues among anglers given the diversity of Sebastes found in California, with at least 36 species regularly encountered in the recreational fishery.  Since 2006, efforts have been made to improve angler identification skills by providing laminated groundfish identification guides and posters to CPFVs to improve compliance with species specific regulations.  Comparisons of the discard rates from retained and discarded catch estimates compared to discard rates from onboard sampling observations of the composition of retained and discarded fish tallied by the observer along each drift for a limited number of anglers indicated underestimates of up roughly 3 times that reported (Table ). A sensitivity was performed to increasing the discard by 3 times as much in the    

#### Length Compositions
Length data (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}) for retained recreational catches sourced by MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2020) were downloaded from the RecFIN website. The lengths of discarded fish measured by samplers onboard CPFVs prior to being released (Type 3d data) from 2003 to 2020 were also downloaded from the RecFIN website.  The number of length observation by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:rec_length_SampleSize}. The highest samples by year occurred within the last 16 years of the modeled period. The recreational lengths reflect limited signalling of recruitment strength in the length data as only the largest individuals are taken (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}).  The mean size observed ranged between 20 to approximately 25 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-data}).The small size of `r spp` and hook size likely limits the ability of hook and line gear to observe smaller fish.

The input sample sizes were assumed equal to the number of length samples available by year. 


### Commercial Fishery

#### Removals
The commercial removals for `r spp` are extremely sparse throughout the time series. The small size and affinity for rocky reefs makes this both an undesirable fish to market, and one difficult to reach with trawl gear.
were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, 'non-trawl', and 'unknown' gear categories. Commercial landing between 1969 - 1980 were queried from the CALCOM database. Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database, extracted 22 February, 2021. 

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards.  Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data between `r startyr` to 2001 to account for total removals was calculated based on the average discard rates from WCGOP of 28 percent. 

#### Length Compositions
The annual length samples from the commercial fishery was limited (Table \ref{tab:com-len}).  The sizes observed were generally between 20 - 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:bubble-comm-len-data} and Figure \ref{fig:comm-mean-len-data}). Given the limited number of samples by year and the lack of commercial catches in the removal time series, the commerical removals were added to the recretaional samples and the commercial lengths were excluded. A sensitivity to assuming 1 (recreational only) or 2 (commerical and recreational) fleets were explored.
