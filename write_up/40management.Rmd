## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying and $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2023-2032 with all removals allocated to between the commercial and recreational fleets (Table \ref{tab:projectionES}). The removals in 2021 and 2022 were set based on the adopted Annual Catch Limits (ACLs). 

The decision table uncertainty axes and catch levels to be determined later.

## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The estimated uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` spawning output is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` OFL is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma,2)`. The estimated model uncertainty was less than the category 2 groundfish data moderate assessment default value of  $\sigma$ = 1.0. 

## Research and Data Needs

The abiltiy to estimate additional process and biological parameters for `r spp` was limited by data. Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:
