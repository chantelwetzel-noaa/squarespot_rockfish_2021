# Assessment Model

## Summary of Previous Assessments 



### Bridging Analysis




## Model Structure and Assumptions

`r Spp` area assessed using a two-sex model with sex specific life history parameters.   

### Modeling Platform and Structure

Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 was used to estimate the parameters in the model. The R package r4ss, version 1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits.

## Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off the California coast. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.
